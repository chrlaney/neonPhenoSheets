Description: NEON field operations crew do weekly phenological observations along one 
    kilometer-long transect at each site. They enter data on paper sheets, type the data 
    into the NEON phenology web UI, and can then download a .csv file with the information 
    they entered along with information from lookup tables. The purpose of this application 
    is to read the .csv file and populate a new data sheet for use in the field during the 
    next weekly bout.
